    "2- Another common practice is to try and avoid having very large changes that modify a lot of different things\n",
    "\n",
    "3- We called out already that when working on a big change, it makes sense to have a separate feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- To make the final merge of the feature branch easier, it makes sense to regularly merge changes made on the master branch back onto the feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- If you need to maintain more than one version of a project at the same time, it's common practice to have the latest version of the project in the master branch and a stable version of the project on a separate branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- So as a general rule, you shouldn't rebase changes that have been pushed to remote repos."
