    "## CPU Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU bound means the program is bottlenecked by the CPU (Central Processing Unit). When your program is waiting for I/O (e.g., disk read/write, network read/write), the CPU is free to do other tasks, even if your program is stopped. The speed of your program will mostly depend on how fast that I/O can happen; if you want to speed it up, you'll need to speed up the I/O. If your program is running lots of program instructions and not waiting for I/O, then it's CPU bound. Speeding up the CPU will make the program run faster.\n",

    "This shows that CPU utilization is low. Here, you have a CPU with multiple cores; this means one fully loaded CPU thread/virtual core equals 1.2% of total load. So, it only uses one core of the CPU regardless of having multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you check the CPU usage, and it looks like the script only uses a single core to run. But your server has a bunch of cores, which means the task is **CPU-bound.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using **psutil.disk_io_counters() and psutil.net_io_counters(**) you'll get **byte read and byte write** for disk I/O and **byte received and byte sent for the network I/O bandwidth**. For checking disk I/O, you can use the following command:\n",

    "\n",
    "rsync(remote sync) is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification time and size of files. One of the important features of rsync is that it works on the delta transfer algorithm, which means it'll only sync or copy the changes from the source to the destination instead of copying the whole file. This ultimately reduces the amount of data sent over the network.\n",
