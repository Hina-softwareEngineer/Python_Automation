    "We can create and define our classes in Python similar to how we define functions. We start with the class keyword, followed by the name of our class and a colon. Python style guidelines recommend class names to start with a capital letter. After the class definition line is the class body, indented to the right. Inside the class body, we can define attributes for the class.\n",
