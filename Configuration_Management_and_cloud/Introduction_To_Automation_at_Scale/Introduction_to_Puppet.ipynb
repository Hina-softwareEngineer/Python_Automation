    "## What is Puppet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet is the current industry standard for managing the configuration of computers in a fleet of machines. Part of the reason why Puppet is so popular is that it's a cross-platform tool that's been around for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically deploy puppet using a **client-server architecture**. The client is known as the Puppet agent, and the service is known as the Puppet master. When using this model, the agent connects to the master and sends a bunch of facts that describe the computer to the master. The master then processes this information, generates the list of rules that need to be applied on the device, and sends this list back to the agent. The agent is then in charge of making any necessary changes on the computer. **Puppet is a cross-platform application available for all Linux distributions, Windows, and Mac OS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various installation tools available depending on the type of operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet will determine the type of operating system being used and select the right tool to perform the package installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**On Linux distributions, there are several package management systems like APT, Yum, and DNF. Puppet will also determine which package manager should be used to install the package**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*On Mac OS, there's a few different available providers depending on where the package is coming from*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The Apple Provider is used for packages that are part of the OS, while the MacPorts provider is used for packages that come from the MacPorts Project*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*For Windows, we'll need to add an extra attribute to our rule, stating where the installer file is located on the local desk or a network mounted resource*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet will then execute the installer and make sure that it finishes successfully. If you use **Chocolatey to manage your windows packages, you can add an extra Chocolatey provider to Puppet to support that.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add, remove, or modify configuration files stored in the system, or change registry entries on Windows. We can also enable, disable, start, or stop the services that run on our computer. We can configure crone jobs, the scheduled tasks, add, remove, or modify Users and Groups or even execute external commands, if that's what we need. There's a lot to say about puppet. "

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, our example used the package keyword declaring a **package resource**. **In puppet, resources are the basic unit for modeling the configuration that we want to manage**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, each resource specifies one configuration that we're trying to manage, like a **service, a package, or a file**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another example. In this case, we're defining a file resource. This resource type is used for managing files and directories. In this case, it's a very simple rule that ensures that etc/sysctl.d exists and is a directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "The configuration of the resource is then written inside a block of curly braces. Right after the opening curly brace, we have the title of the resource, followed by a colon. After the colon come the attributes that we want to set for the resource. In this example, we're once again setting the ensure attribute with directory as the value, but we could set other attributes too.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resource has three attributes. First, we explicitly say that this will be a file instead of a directory or a symlink then we set the contents of the file to the UTC time zone. Finally, we set the replace attribute to true, which means that the contents of the file will be replaced even if the file already exists\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do these rules turn into changes in our computers? \n",
    "\n",
    "When we declare a resource in our puppet rules. We're defining the desired state of that resource in the system. The puppet agent then turns the desired state into reality using providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The provider used will depend on the resource defined and the environment where the agent is running**. Puppet will normally detect this automatically without us having to do anything special."

    "Let's check out an example like that. In this case, we have a class with three resources,**a package, a file, and a service. All of them are related to the Network Time Protocol, or NTP, the mechanism our computers use to synchronize the clocks**. \n",
    "1. Our rules are making sure that the NTP package is always upgraded to the latest version. \n",
    "2. We're setting the contents of the configuration file using the source attribute, which means that the agent will read the required contents from the specified location. \n",
