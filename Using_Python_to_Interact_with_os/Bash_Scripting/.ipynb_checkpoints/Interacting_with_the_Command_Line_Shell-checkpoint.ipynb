    "## Signalling Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "we might have a program that starts a background process and wants it to terminate after a timeout. One way of communicating this is through the pipelines we learned .\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of communicating is through the use of signals. Signals are tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action. Using signals, we can tell a program that we want it to pause or terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's execute the ping command in our terminal.\n",
    "The ping command is now running, sending ICMP packets to machine over the network once per second. And it will keep running forever unless we interrupt it. To do that, we can use the Ctrl-C combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ctrl-C** is the process received a signal indicating that we wanted it to stop. When that signal's received, the process does whatever it needs to finish cleanly. The signal that control see sense is called SIGINT. It's just one of many signals that we can send.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another keyboard combination that we can use to send a signal is **Ctrl-Z**. The signal that we sent is called SIGSTOP.This time the process didn't finish properly. We get a message saying that it's stopped. The signal that we sent is called SIGSTOP. This signal causes the program to stop running without actually terminating. But don't worry, we can make it run again by executing fg. \n",
    "The **fg** command makes our program run once more and will keep going until we interrupt it either with Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z, or some other signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To send other signals, we can use the command called **Kill, yikes**. By default, **Kill will send a signal called SIGTERM** that tells the program to terminate. Since Kill is a separate program, we need to run it on a separate terminal. And we also need to know the process identifier or PID of the process that we want to send the signal to. To find out the PID that we want to send the signal to, we'll use the ps command which list the currently running processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "we'll call **ps ax**, which lists all the running processes in the current computer. And then we'll use the **grep** command to only keep lines that contain the name of the process that we're looking for."
