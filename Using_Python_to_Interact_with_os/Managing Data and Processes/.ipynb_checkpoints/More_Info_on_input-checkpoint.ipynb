    "There are some subtle differences in how data streams are handled in Python 3 and older versions, such as Python 2. Let’s just focus on input() and raw_input(), because they work differently in Python 2 and 3, and you would want to use one or the other depending on the Python version.\n",

    "Finally, it’s worth noting, raw_input doesn’t natively exist in Python 3, but there are some tricky ways to force the interpreter to evaluate raw_input in backwards compatible ways. This can be useful for modernizing legacy Python code without rewriting large portions of it. Research on this topic is better left to the reader, as there are lots of fun (and sometimes scary) ways of doing this.\n",
