    "A **web application** is an application that you interact with over HTTP. Most of the time when you’re using a website on the Internet, you’re interacting with a web application. So, how does this look behind the scenes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your web browser sends an HTTP request to a web server. Then, the web server passes the request along to the web application in charge of deciding what information to show you. The application then generates the website content (in HTML format). The application is also in charge of serving images and any other necessary data so that your web browser can render the website on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of web applications also have APIs that you can use from your scripts! Web applications that have an API are also known as **web services**. Instead of browsing to a web page to type and click around, you can use your program to send a message known as an **API call** to the web service. The part of the program that listens on the network for API calls is called an **API endpoint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you interact with a web service like this, you don't even care what language the other application is using. You interact with it using a specified protocol, and the only important constraint is that both the service and your program know how to use this protocol."

    "## Data Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have two programs that need to communicate with each other, how do you get that data from one place to another? We're going to talk about two aspects of that problem: what to send, and how to send it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what do you send? When you have a conversation with another person, you don't send thoughts and memories directly between your brains. At least not yet! You first have to convert your thoughts into language, and then transmit that language to another person. They take that language, and convert it back into thoughts. It’s the same with programs running in different places, or at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous course, we took a list of lists in memory and wrote it to disk as a **Comma-Separated Value (CSV)** file. This is one example of a technique called **data serialization**. Data serialization is the process of taking an in-memory data structure, like a Python object, and turning it into something that can be stored on disk or transmitted across a network. Later, the file can be read, or the network transmission can be received by another program and turned back into an object again. Turning the serialized object back into an in-memory object is called **deserialization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data serialization is extremely useful for communicating with web services. A web service's API endpoint takes messages in a specific format, containing specific data. By the end of this module, we'll be sending messages to web services, but for now let's concentrate on how to serialize Python objects into some common formats."

    "## Data Serialization Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots and lots of ways to serialize data. In this course, we'll cover a couple of the most common ones and we'll look into how you can use them from Python. Once you get the hang of how this works, it's super easy to use a different format if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is the serialization format that we'll use the most in this course. We'll go into some details later but, for now, let's just use the json module to convert our people list of dictionaries into JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('people.json', 'w') as people_json:\n",
    "    json.dump(people, people_json, indent=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses the json.dump() function to serialize the people object into a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)** has a lot in common with JSON. They’re both formats that can be easily understood by a human when looking at the contents. In this example, we’re using the yaml.safe_dump() method to serialize our object into YAML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('people.yaml', 'w') as people_yaml:\n",
    "    yaml.safe_dump(people, people_yaml)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a couple of the most common data serialization formats. We've left out some other pretty common ones like Python pickle, Protocol Buffers, or the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Each of them is useful in a specific context, although not the focus of this course. You can read more about them by following those links.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More About JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, we've seen a couple of different serialization formats. Let's now dive into more details about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which you'll be using in the lab at the end of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned before, JSON is human-readable, which means it’s encoded using printable characters, and formatted in a way that a human can understand. This doesn't necessarily mean that you will understand it when you look at it, but you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of web services send messages back and forth using JSON. In this module, and in future ones, you’ll serialize JSON messages to send to a web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON supports a few elements of different data types. These are very basic data types; they represent the most common basic data types supported by any programming language that you might use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON has strings, which are enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "- JSON has objects, which are key-value pair structures like Python dictionaries.\n",
    "- JSON has arrays, which are equivalent to Python lists. Arrays can contain strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays.\n",
    "-  JSON elements are always comma-delimited. With these basics under your belt, you could create valid JSON by hand, and edit examples of JSON that you encounter. Except we don't really want to do that, since it's clunky and we’re bound to make a ton of errors! Instead, let’s use the json library that does all the heavy lifting for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The json library will help us turn Python objects into JSON, and turn JSON strings into Python objects! The dump() method serializes basic Python objects, writing them to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON doesn't need to contain multiple lines, but it sure can be hard to read the result if it's formatted this way! Let's use the indent parameter for json.dump() to make it a bit easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use the dumps() method, which also serializes Python objects, but returns a string instead of writing directly to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The load() method does the inverse of the dump() method. It deserializes JSON from a file into basic Python objects. The loads() method also deserializes JSON into basic Python objects, but parses a string instead of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that JSON elements can only represent simple data types. If you have complex Python objects, you won’t be able to automatically serialize them as JSON. Take a look at [this table](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#py-to-json-table) to see in detail how Python objects are converted into JSON elements.\n",
